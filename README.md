LaTeX Template and BibLaTeX bibliography style for Southampton Solent University reports.

## Why use LaTeX?

Formatting in Microsoft Word (and other document editors) is notoriously painful. LaTeX separates concerns by defining 
the layout as code, meaning you can focus on the content of your work without messing things up.

It can also parse exported references into the document in the Solent-Harvard format, and will work with tools like RefWorks or Zotero.

## Disclaimer

Every effort has been made to ensure that this template accurately produces documents in the required format. However, responsibility lies with the user in the event that it produces incorrectly formatted or corrupted content.

Therefore, it is strongly advised that:

- Document generation is tested at the earliest possible stage (LaTeX can take a long time to install).
- Generated content is tested and proofread prior to submission.

## Usage

### Headings

You can define headings at levels one through four, as follows:

1. `/chapter{chapter name}`
2. `/section{section name}`
3. `/subsection{subsection name}`
4. `/subsubsection{subsubsection name}`

### Paragraphs

Write paragraphs in plaintext, separated by newlines:

```tex
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam auctor diam augue, at fermentum mauris cursus eget.

Fusce mauris dolor, egestas quis molestie ac, semper et libero. Pellentesque varius eros in dui porta suscipit.
```

### Images

To insert an image, use the following code block:

```tex
\begin{center}

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{your_image}
    \captionof{figure}{Example image}

\end{center}
```

In the example above:

- LaTeX looks for an image called `your_image.png` in the `./images/` folder.
- The figure has the caption "*Figure X.X: Example image*".

*Note: This repository's `.gitignore` ***ignores*** images by default. If you want to include them in version control, omit  `images/*`.*

### Referencing & Citations

#### Supported Sources

Solent-Harvard style requires custom drivers for each type of source. These exist for the following source types:

- Online Sources (`@online`)
- Books (`@book`)
- Conference papers (`@inproceedings`)
- Journal Articles (`@article`)
- Standards & others (`@misc`)

#### References

References go in the `refs.bib` file in BibTeX format. You can generate these with a reference management tool such as RefWorks or Zotero.

References in this file will be automatically formatted and parsed into the document upon creation.

#### Citations

 Use `\cite{id}` anywhere in your document to cite a source.

 When the author name is in the text, use `\citeyear{id}` to exclude the author name from the citation.

### Code Blocks

The `minted` package can be used to automatically highlight code, but there are some prerequisites if you are doing this locally. For this reason, it is disabled by default, but can be enabled by uncommenting the following lines in `master.tex`:

```latex
% Code
% \usepackage{minted}
```

Then, you will need to set up the `pygments` syntax highlighter. Assuming you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed, the following commands will do this (depending on your OS).

1. `python3 -m /path/to/venv`
2. `source /path/to/venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install pygments`

You will need to re-run the second command to activate the virtual environment every time you close the terminal.

Then, you can add `minted` blocks which typically look something like this:

```latex
\begin{minted}[linenos,breaklines]{<your_programming_language>}
    <your_code_here>
\end{minted}
```

However, there are lots of other options. More information is available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Code_Highlighting_with_minted).

## Generating a PDF document

The easiest way to use LaTeX is with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)â€”just import a copy of the template. Alternatively, you can install it locally on Linux or Windows. Below are instructions for local installations.

### Linux & Windows

1. [Install LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).
2. To generate `master.pdf`, open a terminal and run the command below:
    ```
    pdflatex master.tex
    ```
3. If you are using BibLaTeX, run `biber` *after* `pdflatex` and then re-run it:

    ```
    biber master && pdflatex master.tex
    ```
